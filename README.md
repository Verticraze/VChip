# VChip - A CHIP-8 Emulator

**VChip** is a basic,portable CHIP-8 emulator written in C++. It aims to be simple, accurate, functional and serves as a great introduction for learning basic principles of the working of emulators.
## ðŸ•¹ What is CHIP-8?
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language which was developed in the 1970s by Joseph Weisbrecker on an 1802 microprocessor.It was used on COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800, both of which were 8 bit microcomputers.
It consists of 16 8-bit registers, 4kB of memory, a hexadecimal keypad, a monochrome display spanning 64x32 pixels.
